            <div _ngcontent-tjl-c5 class="symposia-text">
                A future ‘Smart Distributed Electrical Energy Network’ will serve as a dynamic network for
                multi-directional energy flows, linking widely distributed small capacity intermittent renewable energy
                systems at consumer level (distribution network) and centralized higher-capacity power generators,
                facilitating active participation of customer choice for demand side management, energy production /
                storage, and providing real- time information on the performance and optimal operation of the smart
                electrical energy network. <br _ngcontent-tjl-c5="">

                We all live and work in buildings. Keeping buildings comfortable is one of the main
                energy uses
                in developed countries. How shall we do so in a future sustainable
                society? This calls for a joint
                effort on building and district energy modelling and
                planning; high performance designs for
                new-built and retrofitted buildings and
                building services; optimal operation and maintenance
                of building services;
                occupant-centric design for well-being; forecasting and optimization
                processes for
                flexible operation; and integration with Renewable Energy Systems and increasingly electrified systems,
                among many other issues. This session will focus on how to do this with the tools available to the Energy
                Engineering
                professionals in the 21st century. With Energy Informatics and
                increasingly available data
                sources on operational performance of buildings. Insights
                on the applicability of designs andtechnologies in varied technological, cultural and
                development contexts will also be welcome.<br _ngcontent-tjl-c5="">

                In this Special Session, we will gather evidence from existing research regarding the intersection of
                Citizen Science, Artificial Intelligence, data from space (e.g., Copernicus), and IoT (e.g., low-cost
                sensors) to create communal smart environments where synergy and symbiosis among the agents are enabled.
                We are especially interested in experiences where people collaborate with other people and machines in
                activities such as data collection (e.g., participatory/opportunistic sensing), modeling, hypothesis
                testing, analysis, and outreaching for a wide range of applications of crowd-sourced, Internet- based
                information with the focus on pro-environmentalism and pursuing activism towards preserving the planet
                or co-ideate adaptation strategies to new environmental events related to climate change (e.g., improve
                the air that we all breath). <br _ngcontent-tjl-c5="">
